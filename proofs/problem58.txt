theorem
  for s being Nat
   ex f being fAP-like increasing positive-yielding FinSequence of NAT
  st len f = s & for i being Nat st 1 <= i <= len f holds f.i is perfect_power
  proof
    let s be Nat;
    per cases;
    suppose
A1:   s = 0;
      take <*>NAT;
      thus thesis by A1;
    end;
    suppose s <> 0;
      then reconsider s1 = s as non zero Nat;
      take f = Problem58Solution(s1);
      thus
A2:   len f = s by CARD_1:def 7;
      let k be Nat such that
A3:   1 <= k and
A4:   k <= len f;
      reconsider k as non zero Nat by A3;
      take sequenceQk(s).k;
      take primenumber(k-1);
      thus primenumber(k-1) > 1 by INT_2:def 4;
      thus thesis by A2,A4,Th50;
    end;
  end;

theorem
  for p being odd Prime holds
  {n where n is Nat: p divides CullenNumber n} is infinite
  proof
    let p be odd Prime;
    set S = {n where n is Nat: p divides CullenNumber n};
    deffunc F(Nat) = (p-1)*($1*p+1);
    consider f being ManySortedSet of NAT such that
A1: for i being Element of NAT holds f.i = F(i) from PBOOLE:sch 5;
    set R = rng f;
A2: dom f = NAT by PARTFUN1:def 2;
A3: R c= S
    proof
      let x be object;
      assume x in R;
      then consider m being object such that
A4:   m in dom f and
A5:   x = f.m by FUNCT_1:def 3;
      reconsider m as Element of NAT by A4,PARTFUN1:def 2;
A6:   f.m = F(m) by A1;
      set n = (p-1)*(m*p+1);
      p divides CullenNumber n by Th50;
      hence x in S by A5,A6;
    end;
    for m being Nat ex N being Nat st N >= m & N in R
    proof
      let m be Nat;
      take n = F(m+1);
A7:   m+0 <= m+1 by XREAL_1:6;
      1 < p by INT_2:def 4;
      then
A8:   (m+1)*1 <= (m+1)*p by XREAL_1:64;
A9:   (m+1)*p+0 <= (m+1)*p+1 by XREAL_1:6;
      1 <= p-1 by INT_2:def 4,INT_1:52;
      then 1*((m+1)*p+1) <= (p-1)*((m+1)*p+1) by XREAL_1:64;
      hence n >= m by A7,A8,A9,Th2;
      f.(m+1) = n by A1;
      hence n in R by A2,FUNCT_1:def 3;
    end;
    hence thesis by A3,PYTHTRIP:9;
  end;

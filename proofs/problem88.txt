  n > 7 implies
  ex m being Nat, p, q being Prime st p <> q &
  (m = n or m = n+1 or m = n+2) & p divides m & q divides m
  proof
    assume
A1: n > 7;
    assume
A2: not thesis;
    then not 2 divides n or not 3 divides n by XPRIMES1:2,3;
    then
A3: not 2*3 divides n by NUMBER04:3;
    not 2 divides n+1 or not 3 divides n+1 by A2,XPRIMES1:2,3;
    then
A4: not 2*3 divides n+1 by NUMBER04:3;
    not 2 divides n+2 or not 3 divides n+2 by A2,XPRIMES1:2,3;
    then
A5: not 2*3 divides n+2 by NUMBER04:3;
    consider k such that
A6: n = 6*k or n = 6*k+1 or n = 6*k+2 or n = 6*k+3 or n = 6*k+4 or n = 6*k+5
    by NUMBER02:26;
A7: n is having_exactly_one_prime_divisor
    proof
      consider p being Element of NAT such that
A8:   p is prime and
A9:   p divides n by A1,XXREAL_0:2,INT_2:31;
      reconsider p as Prime by A8;
      take p;
      thus thesis by A2,A9;
    end;
A10: n+1 is having_exactly_one_prime_divisor
    proof
      n+1 > n+0 by XREAL_1:8;
      then n+1 > 7 by A1,XXREAL_0:2;
      then consider p being Element of NAT such that
A11:   p is prime and

      take p;
      thus thesis by A2,A12;
    end;
A13: n+2 is having_exactly_one_prime_divisor
    proof
      n+2 > n+0 by XREAL_1:8;
      then n+2 > 7 by A1,XXREAL_0:2;
      then consider p being Element of NAT such that
A14:   p is prime and
A15:   p divides n+2 by INT_2:31,XXREAL_0:2;
      reconsider p as Prime by A14;

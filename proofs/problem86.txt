theorem
  14 satisfies_Sierpinski_problem_86
  proof
    reconsider a = 3 as Prime by XPRIMES1:3;
    reconsider b = 5 as Prime by XPRIMES1:5;
    reconsider c = 13 as Prime by XPRIMES1:13;
    take a,b,c;
    thus thesis by Th54;
  end;

theorem
  n satisfies_Sierpinski_problem_86 & n <= 32 implies n in {14,16,20,22,32}
  proof
    assume
A1: n satisfies_Sierpinski_problem_86;
    assume n <= 32;
    then n = 0 or ... or n = 32;
    hence thesis by A1,Th50,Lm16,Lm17,Lm18,Lm19,Lm20,Lm21,
    Lm22,Lm23,Lm24,Lm25,Lm26,Lm27,Lm28,Lm29,Lm30,

theorem
  {n where n is Nat: n divides 2|^n+1} is infinite
  proof
    set S = {n where n is Nat: n divides 2|^n+1};
    deffunc F(Nat) = 3|^$1;
    consider f being ManySortedSet of NAT such that
A1: for i being Element of NAT holds f.i = F(i) from PBOOLE:sch 5;
    set R = rng f;
A2: dom f = NAT by PARTFUN1:def 2;
A3: R c= S
    proof
      let x be object;
      assume x in R;
      then consider m being object such that
A4:   m in dom f and
A5:   x = f.m by FUNCT_1:def 3;
      reconsider m as Element of NAT by A4,PARTFUN1:def 2;
A6:   f.m = F(m) by A1;
      3|^m divides 2|^(3|^m)+1 by Th37;
      hence x in S by A5,A6;
    end;
    for m being Nat ex N being Nat st N >= m & N in R
    proof
      let m be Nat;
      take n = F(m+1);
A7:   m <= 3|^m by NEWTON:86;
      m+0 <= m+1 by XREAL_1:6;
      then 3|^m <= 3|^(m+1) by NAT_6:1;
      hence n >= m by A7,XXREAL_0:2;
      f.(m+1) = n by A1;
      hence n in R by A2,FUNCT_1:def 3;
    end;
    hence thesis by A3,PYTHTRIP:9;
  end;

theorem
  {n where n is Nat: n divides 2|^n+1 & n is prime} = {3}
  proof
    set S = {n where n is Nat: n divides 2|^n+1 & n is prime};
    thus S c= {3}
    proof
      let x be object;
      assume x in S;
      then consider n such that
A1:   x = n and
A2:   n divides 2|^n+1 and
A3:   n is prime;
A4:   (2|^n+1) mod n = 0 by A2,A3,INT_1:62;
A5:   n <> 2 by A2;
      1+1 <= n by A3,NAT_1:13;
      then 2 < n by A5,XXREAL_0:1;
      then
A6:   2 mod n = 2 by NAT_D:24;
A7:   (2|^n) mod n = 2 mod n by A3,EULER_2:19;
A8:   (2|^n+1-2|^n) mod n = (((2|^n+1) mod n) - ((2|^n) mod n)) mod n
      by INT_6:7;
      (1--2) mod n = ((1 mod n) - ((-2) mod n)) mod n by INT_6:7;
      then n divides 3 by A3,A4,A7,A6,A8,INT_1:62;
      then n = 3 by A3,PEPIN:41;
      hence thesis by A1,TARSKI:def 1;
    end;
    let x be object;
    assume x in {3};
    then
A9: x = 3 by TARSKI:def 1;
    3|^1 divides 2|^(3|^1)+1 by Th37;
    hence thesis by A9,PEPIN:41;
  end;

theorem
  not ex n being Nat st 1 < n & n divides 2|^n-1
  proof
    given n being Nat such that
A1: 1 < n and
A2: n divides 2|^n-1;
    defpred P[Nat] means 1 < $1 & $1 divides 2|^$1-1;
A3: ex k being Nat st P[k] by A1,A2;
    consider N being Nat such that
A4: P[N] and
A5: for n being Nat st P[n] holds N <= n from NAT_1:sch 5(A3);
    N divides 2|^N-1 by A4;
    then reconsider N as odd Element of NAT by A4,ORDINAL1:def 12;
    set E = Euler N;
    set d = N gcd E;
A6: 1 mod N = 1 by A4,NAT_D:14;
    reconsider k = 2|^N-1 as Nat;
    2,N are_coprime by A4,Th45;
    then 2|^E mod N = 1 by A4,EULER_2:18;
    then 2|^E-1 mod N = (1-1) mod N by A6,INT_6:7
    .= 0;
    then N divides 2|^E-1 by INT_1:62;
    then
A7: N divides (2|^N - 1) gcd (2|^E - 1) by A4,INT_2:def 2;
A8: (2|^N - 1) gcd (2|^E - 1) = 2|^d - 1 by Th26;
A9: now
      assume d <= 1;
      then d < 1 or d = 1 by XXREAL_0:1;
      hence contradiction by A4,A7,A8,NAT_1:14,WSIERP_1:15;
    end;
A10: d <= E by Th13;
A11: d divides N by INT_2:def 2;
A12: E <= N-1 by A4,EULER_1:19;
    N-1 < N-0 by XREAL_1:15;
    then E < N by A12,XXREAL_0:2;
    then d < N by A10,XXREAL_0:2;
    hence contradiction by A5,A11,A9,A7,A8,INT_2:9;
  end;

theorem
  for n being non zero Nat holds
    n gcd (Fermat n) = 1
  proof
    let n be non zero Nat;
Z1: n gcd (Fermat n) >= 1 by NAT_1:14;
    assume n gcd (Fermat n) <> 1; then
    n gcd (Fermat n) > 1 by Z1,XXREAL_0:1; then
    n gcd (Fermat n) >= 1 + 1 by NAT_1:13; then
    consider p being Element of NAT such that
J1: p is prime & p divides (n gcd (Fermat n)) by INT_2:31;
    reconsider p as Prime by J1;
a1: n gcd (Fermat n) divides n & n gcd (Fermat n) divides Fermat n
      by NAT_D:def 5; then
B1: p <= n by NAT_D:7,J1,NAT_D:4;
    p > 1 by INT_2:def 4; then
    p >= 1 + 1 by NAT_1:13; then
    per cases by XXREAL_0:1;
    suppose p = 2;
      hence thesis by J1;
    end;
    suppose
      p > 2; then
      consider k being Element of NAT such that
A2:   p = k * (2 |^ (n + 1)) + 1 by a1,PEPIN:56,J1,NAT_D:4;
      k <> 0 by A2,INT_2:def 4; then
      k * (2 |^ (n + 1)) >= 1 * (2 |^ (n + 1)) by XREAL_1:64,NAT_1:14; then
G2:   k * (2 |^ (n + 1)) + 1 >= 2 |^ (n + 1) + 1 by XREAL_1:7;
      2 |^ (n + 1) >= n + 1 by NEWTON:86; then
      2 |^ (n + 1) > n by NAT_1:13; then
      2 |^ (n + 1) + 1 > n by NAT_1:13;
      hence thesis by B1,A2,G2,XXREAL_0:2;
    end;
  end;

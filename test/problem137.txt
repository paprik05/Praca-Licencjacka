theorem
  { [x,y] where x,y is positive Nat: 3*x^2-7*y^2+1 = 0 } is infinite
  proof
    deffunc R(Complex,Complex) = 3*$1^2-7*$2^2+1;
    set A = {[x,y] where x,y is positive Nat: R(x,y) = 0};
A1: R(3,2) = 0;
    then [3,2] in A;
    then reconsider A as non empty set;
    deffunc p1(Real,Real) = 55*$1+84*$2+0;
    deffunc p2(Real,Real) = 36*$1+55*$2+0;
    defpred P[object,Element of [:NAT,NAT:],Element of [:NAT,NAT:]] means
    $3 = [p1($2`1,$2`2),p2($2`1,$2`2)];
    set f = recSeqCart(3,2,55,84,0,36,55,0);
A2: dom f = NAT by PARTFUN1:def 2;
    defpred N[Nat] means f.$1 in A;
    f.0 = [3,2] by Def10;
    then
A3: N[0] by A1;
A4: N[a] implies N[a+1]
    proof
      assume N[a];
      then consider x,y being positive Nat such that
A5:   f.a = [x,y] & R(x,y) = 0;
      set m = (f.a)`1;
      set n = (f.a)`2;
A6:   f.(a+1) = [p1(m,n),p2(m,n)] by Def10;
A7:   m > 0 & n > 0 by Th89;
      R(p1(m,n),p2(m,n)) = 0 by A5;
      hence thesis by A6,A7;
    end;
A8: N[a] from NAT_1:sch 2(A3,A4);
A9: rng f c= A
    proof
      let y be object;
      assume y in rng f;
      then ex k being object st k in dom f & f.k = y by FUNCT_1:def 3;
      hence thesis by A8;
    end;
    f is one-to-one by Th92;
    hence thesis by A2,A9,CARD_1:59;
  end;

theorem
  10 divides a|^10 + 1 iff ex k st a = 10*k+3 or a = 10*k+7
  proof
    thus 10 divides a|^10 + 1 implies ex k st a = 10*k+3 or a = 10*k+7
    proof
      assume 10 divides a|^10 + 1;
      then consider r,k being Nat such that
A1:   a = 10*k+r and
A2:   10 divides r|^10+1 and
A3:   r = 0 or ... or r = 9 by Th30;
      take k;
      per cases by A3;
      suppose r = 0;
        hence a = 10*k+3 or a = 10*k+7 by A2,INT_2:27;
      end;
      suppose r = 1;
        hence a = 10*k+3 or a = 10*k+7 by A2,INT_2:27;
      end;
      suppose r = 2;
        hence a = 10*k+3 or a = 10*k+7 by A2,Lm25;
      end;
      suppose r = 3;
        hence a = 10*k+3 or a = 10*k+7 by A1;
      end;
      suppose r = 4;
        hence a = 10*k+3 or a = 10*k+7 by A2,Lm26,Th5;
      end;
      suppose r = 5;
        hence a = 10*k+3 or a = 10*k+7 by A2,Lm27,Th6;
      end;
      suppose r = 6;
        hence a = 10*k+3 or a = 10*k+7 by A2,Lm28,Th7;
      end;
      suppose r = 7;
        hence a = 10*k+3 or a = 10*k+7 by A1;
      end;
      suppose r = 8;
        hence a = 10*k+3 or a = 10*k+7 by A2,Lm29,Th9;
      end;
      suppose r = 9;
        hence a = 10*k+3 or a = 10*k+7 by A2,Lm30,Th10;
      end;
    end;
    given k such that
A4: a = 10*k+3 or a = 10*k+7;
    per cases by A4;
    suppose
A5:   a = 10*k+3;
      3 = 0 or ... or 3 = 9;
      hence 10 divides a|^10 + 1 by A5,Th4,INT_1:def 3,Th30;
    end;
    suppose
A6:   a = 10*k+7;
      7 = 0 or ... or 7 = 9;
      hence 10 divides a|^10 + 1 by A6,Th8,INT_1:def 3,Th30;
    end;
  end;

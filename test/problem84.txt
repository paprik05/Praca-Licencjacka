  { [p,q] where p,q is Prime: p,q are_not_twin } is infinite
  proof
    set A = {[p,q] where p,q is Prime: p,q are_not_twin};
    deffunc pk(non zero Nat) = LP<=6n+1($1);
    deffunc F(non zero Nat) = [ pk($1) , primenumber(1+primeindex pk($1)) ];
    defpred P[Nat,object] means ex n being non zero Nat st n = $1 & $2 = F(n);
    set P = 6n+1_Primes;
    deffunc C(Element of P) = In(($1-1) div 6,NAT);
    consider C being Function of P,NAT such that
A1: for p being Element of P holds C.p = C(p) from FUNCT_2:sch 4;
A2: dom C = P by FUNCT_2:def 1;
A3: now
      let p be Element of P;
      p in P;
      then ex n st p = 6*n+1 & 6*n+1 is prime;
      hence 6*((p-1) div 6) = p-1 by NAT_D:18;
    end;
    C is one-to-one
    proof
      let x1,x2 be object such that
A4:   x1 in dom C and
A5:   x2 in dom C and
A6:   C.x1 = C.x2;
      reconsider x1,x2 as Element of P by A4,A5;
      C.x1 = C(x1) & C.x2 = C(x2) by A1;
      then
A7:   6*((x1-1) div 6) = 6*((x2-1) div 6) by A6;
      6*((x1-1) div 6) = x1-1 & 6*((x2-1) div 6) = x2-1 by A3;
      hence thesis by A7;
    end;
    then reconsider D = rng C as infinite Subset of NAT
    by A2,CARD_1:59,RELAT_1:def 19;
A8: for d being Element of D holds 6*d+1 is prime
    proof
      let d be Element of D;
      consider p being Element of P such that
A9:   d = C.p by FUNCT_2:113;
A10:  C(p) = (p-1) div 6;
      p in P;
      then
A11:  ex n st p = 6*n+1 & 6*n+1 is prime;
      6*((p-1) div 6) = p-1 by A3;
      hence thesis by A1,A9,A10,A11;
    end;
A12: now
      let d be Element of D;
      assume d = 0;
      then 6*0+1 is prime by A8;
      hence contradiction;
    end;
A13: for i being Element of D ex j being object st P[i,j]
    proof
      let i be Element of D;
      reconsider a = i as non zero Nat by A12;
      take F(a);
      thus thesis;
    end;
    consider f being ManySortedSet of D such that
A14: for d being Element of D holds P[d,f.d] from PBOOLE:sch 6(A13);
A15: dom f = D by PARTFUN1:def 2;
A16: rng f c= A
    proof
      let y be object;
      assume y in rng f;
      then consider k being object such that
A17:  k in dom f and
A18:  f.k = y by FUNCT_1:def 3;
      reconsider k as non zero Element of NAT by A12,A15,A17;
A19:  P[k,f.k] by A14,A17;
      pk(k), primenumber(1+primeindex pk(k)) are_not_twin by Th31;
      hence thesis by A18,A19;
    end;
    f is one-to-one
    proof
      let x1,x2 be object such that
A20:  x1 in dom f and
A21:  x2 in dom f and
A22:  f.x1 = f.x2;
      reconsider x1 as non zero Nat by A12,A20;
      reconsider x2 as non zero Nat by A12,A21;
      P[x1,f.x1] & P[x2,f.x2] by A14,A20,A21;
      then
A23:  pk(x1) = pk(x2) by A22,XTUPLE_0:1;
      6*x1+1 is prime & 6*x2+1 is prime by A8,A20,A21;
      hence thesis by A23,Th34;
    end;
    hence thesis by A15,A16,CARD_1:59;

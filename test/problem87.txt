theorem
  n satisfies_Sierpinski_problem_87a & n <= 27 implies n in {13,17,21,23,27}
  proof
    assume
A1: n satisfies_Sierpinski_problem_87a;
    assume n <= 27;
    then n = 0 or ... or n = 27;
    hence thesis by A1,Lm5,Lm6,
    Lm7,Lm8,Lm9,Lm10,Lm11,Lm12,Lm13,Lm14,Lm15,Lm16,
    Lm17,Lm18,Lm19,Lm20,Lm21,Lm22,Lm23,Lm24,Lm25,

theorem
  112 satisfies_Sierpinski_problem_87b
  proof
    5 = 2*2+1;
    then reconsider a = 5 as odd Prime by XPRIMES1:5;
    13 = 2*6+1;
    then reconsider b = 13 as odd Prime by XPRIMES1:13;
    193 = 2*96+1;
    then reconsider c = 193 as odd Prime by XPRIMES1:193;
    take a,b,c;
    thus thesis by Th57;
  end;

theorem
  {p where p is Prime:
   (ex a,b being Prime st p = a+b) & (ex c,d being Prime st p = c-d)}
  = {5}
  proof
    set A = {p where p is Prime:
    (ex a,b being Prime st p = a+b) & (ex c,d being Prime st p = c-d)};
    thus A c= {5}
    proof
      let x be object;
      assume x in A;
      then consider r being Prime such that
A1:   x = r and
A2:   ex a,b being Prime st r = a+b and
A3:   ex c,d being Prime st r = c-d;
      consider a,b being Prime such that
A4:   r = a+b by A2;
      consider c,d being Prime such that
A5:   r = c-d by A3;
A6:   1 < a & 1 < b by INT_2:def 4;
      then
A7:   1+1 < r by A4,XREAL_1:8;
      then
A8:   r is odd by PEPIN:17;
A9:   1+1 <= a & 1+1 <= b by A6,NAT_1:13;
      not a is odd or not b is odd by A4,A7,PEPIN:17;
      then a <= 2 or b <= 2 by PEPIN:17;
      then a = 2 or b = 2 by A9,XXREAL_0:1;
      then consider p being Prime such that
A10:  r = p+2 by A4;
      1 < c & 1 < d by INT_2:def 4;
      then
A11:  1+1 <= c & 1+1 <= d by NAT_1:13;
      not c is odd or not d is odd by A5,A7,PEPIN:17;
      then c <= 2 or d <= 2 by PEPIN:17;
      then
A12:  c = 2 or d = 2 by A11,XXREAL_0:1;
      2-d <= d-d by A11,XREAL_1:9;
      then 2-d <= 0;
      then consider q being Prime such that
A13:  r = q-2 by A5,A12;
      (r+2)-r = 2 & r-(r-2) = 2;
      then r-2 = 3 & r = 5 & r+2 = 7 by A8,A10,A13,Th33;
      hence thesis by A1,TARSKI:def 1;
    end;
    let x be object;
    assume x in {5};
    then
A14: x = 5 by TARSKI:def 1;
    5 = 3+2 & 5 = 7-2;
    hence thesis by A14,PEPIN:41,59,INT_2:28,NAT_4:26;
  end;

theorem
  5|^4+(5+1)|^4 is composite &
  not ex n being Nat st n < 5 & n|^4+(n+1)|^4 is composite
  proof
    set x = 5|^4+(5+1)|^4;
    thus 2 <= x by Lm6,Lm7;
    x = 17 * 113 by Lm6,Lm7;
    hence x is non prime by Th13,PEPIN:60;
    given n being Nat such that
A1: n < 5 and
A2: n|^4+(n+1)|^4 is composite;
    n <= 5-1 by A1,INT_1:52;
    then n = 0 or ... or n = 4;
    hence thesis by A2,Th56,Th57,Th58,Th59;
  end;

theorem Th61:
  1 <= a implies 2|^(2|^n) + (6*a-1) > 6
  proof
    assume 1 <= a;
    then 6*1 <= 6*a by XREAL_1:64;
    then
A1: 6*1-1 <= 6*a-1 by XREAL_1:9;
    0+1 <= 2|^n by NAT_1:13;
    then 2 <= 2|^(2|^n) by PREPOWER:12;
    then 2+5 <= 2|^(2|^n) + (6*a-1) by A1,XREAL_1:7;
    hence thesis by XXREAL_0:2;
  end;
